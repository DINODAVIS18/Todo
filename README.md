# Full Stack Todo Application

This is a full-stack Todo application built with **React** (frontend) and **Express** (backend). The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React application for managing Todo tasks.
- **Backend**: An Express server that handles API requests and connects to a MongoDB database.

The client and server are housed in separate Git branches:

- **Frontend branch** (`frontend`): Contains the client-side React application.
- **Backend branch** (`backend`): Contains the server-side Express application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **MongoDB** (for the backend to work, or you can use MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DINODAVIS18/Todo.git
   cd Todo

---

### Explanation of Changes:
- The **`README.md`** file now clearly mentions that to run both the client and server, you should use `npm start` in their respective directories.
- It guides the user to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run both the frontend and backend servers independently.
- The `frontend` and `backend` branches are mentioned, as well as detailed instructions for setting up both.

This should make it clear for anyone using the project how to set it up and run both parts (client and server) with the `npm start` command.
